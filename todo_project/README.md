## Stack
- Frontend: Single-page HTML + Tailwind CDN + Vanilla JS (keeps it simple & portable)
- Backend: Node.js + Express + lowdb (file-based JSON DB). Optional MongoDB not required.

## Quick start (backend)
1. Install Node.js (v16+ recommended)
2. Open terminal in `backend` folder
```bash
npm install
# create .env from example and set JWT_SECRET (or leave default for testing)
cp .env.example .env
# start server
npm run dev
```
Backend will run at `http://localhost:4000` by default.

## Quick start (frontend)
Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser. The frontend expects backend at `http://localhost:4000` by default.
If you use a different host/port, update `FRONTEND_API_BASE` variable at top of `frontend/app.js`.

## Notes
- Data is stored in `backend/db.json` using lowdb. This is fine for development and assignments.
- For production, replace lowdb with MongoDB or other DB.
- JWT secret is in `.env`. For real projects, keep secrets secure.
